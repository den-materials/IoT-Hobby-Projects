# IoT-Hobby-Projects with the Beaglebone

## Getting Started

Head to [this page](http://beagleboard.org/static/beaglebone/latest/README.htm) to get the drivers installed on your machine.  This will take 5-10 minutes.

## Turning the Light on

Head to [this page](http://www.circuidipity.com/bbb-led.html) for a quick tutorial to get you set up with your "IoT Hello World" by blinking lights!

## Taking the Temperature

Head to [this page](http://www.bonebrews.com/temperature-monitoring-with-the-ds18b20-on-a-beaglebone-black/z) for a tutorial to take the temperature with a digital thermometer.

## Making a Web Server

Just like with any other computer, you can start a web server by creating an `index.html` file and running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.  Make sure python is installed first.

### Is the Button Pressed?

Now that you can turn a light on (output), let's try playing with the other side (input).  Head to [this page](https://learn.adafruit.com/connecting-a-push-button-to-beaglebone-black/overview) for a tutorial on this.

## Turning a Power Strip on

Using `crontab`, and a [solid state relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_relay), you can time a whole power strip of devices to turn off or on at certain times.  This can help cut down on your energy bills.

I used this functionality to create a small garden of lettuce and radishes in my basement apartment bedroom (turning lights on at 7 every morning, and off at 10 ever night).

## Being an Awesome Boyfriend/Girlfriend

For Nina's birthday, I created a mail server that would send a cute quote to her email everytime she pressed a button.  It would also send an email to me to let me know she missed me.
